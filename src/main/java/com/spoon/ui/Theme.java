/**
 * The look of the thing.
 * <p>
 * RuneLite's own palette is flat grey on flat grey, which is right for a tool you glance at and wrong
 * for something people open to see whether they are winning. This is a darker, slightly blue base with
 * gold on top of it — gold because that is what a scoreboard is, and because it reads as a prize
 * rather than as an interface.
 * <p>
 * Kept in one place so a colour can be changed once rather than in nine panels.
